This file contains all the codes for constructing ImRiD database. It includes code to reconstruct raw data of .dat file from MRI MP-RAGE sequence; code to slice from arbitrary angles; and visualization.
MPRAGE_reconstruction.m reconstructs given 3D MP-RAGE sequence.
Slicer3D.m is the main code to run that visualize the 2D slice in 3D space and also generates the 2D planes from 3D volume.
