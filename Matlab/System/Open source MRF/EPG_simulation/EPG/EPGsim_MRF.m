% Note: 
%    (1) phis and alphas must have the same size & be in degrees
%    (2) TRs are in milliseconds; TRs must be the same size as phis &
%    alphas
%    (3) rlx = [T1 T2] in milliseconds(set both to zero for no relaxation) 
% Important: all gradients = 0, so we are always at coherence order 0
%            (i.e. only RF flipping and relaxation happen)
