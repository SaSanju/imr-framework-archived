### What is `imr-framework`?
`imr-framework` is a software framework that transforms a standard MR system into an *MR value driven autonomously functioning* scanner, which can be deemed as an *Intelligent Physical System* (IPS). Check the Github repository [here](https://github.com/imr-framework/imr-framework).

### Library structure
`imr-framework`:
- `amri`: MR value driven autonomous scanner
- `pulseq`: Python translation of the [Pulseq framework](https://pulseq.github.io/) [[1]](#references).
- `pulseq-gpi`: GPI integration of `pulseq` (mentioned above) [[2]](#references)
- `ImRiD`: Image reconstruction database
