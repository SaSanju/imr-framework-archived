## MR Safety
### Setting up your MRI Safety policies and test lab

#### MRI Safety: all responsible

When setting up a new MR system - be it manufactured or built - it is essential to have good safety practices in order to avoid accidents [1,2]. Almost every day, new MR-related injuries are reported from various institutions on the FDA-created MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) platform [3]. Looking up this events database is very helpful to remind us to always pay attention to, and adjust when needed, the safety policies in MRI. 

#### MRI Safety Basics and Policies
The first step is to understand where the risks are coming from. Indeed, specific risks are associated to each of the three electromagnetic fields used to make an MR image: 
-	The static field, B0, will exert an attraction force and a torque on any ferromagnetic object or implant. This field is thus linked to the so-called “projectile effect”. Importantly, the static field is always on.
-	The radiofrequency (RF) field B1 is responsible for the heating or even burn of the subject during the scan. This heating risk will be further enhanced in presence of a metallic medical device. Radiofrequency fields can also induce voltages on active devices such as pacemaker or neurostimulators, which can lead to unwanted or inefficient stimulation. 
-	The gradient fields are responsible for the noise made by the MR machine during a scan that can lead to hearing loss without adequate protection. Furthermore, gradients field can induce Peripheral Nerve Stimulation in the subject, and cause vibration on metallic implants. Similar to radiofrequency, gradient fields can also induce voltages on active devices.
To make it easier to know if an object or device can safely enter the MR magnet room, and under which conditions an implanted subject may be scanned, the FDA created three labels [4]: 

![MR Safe](/assets/mrsafety/mrsafe.jpeg) MR Safe: no known hazard in all MR environments;

![MR Conditional](/assets/mrsafety/mrconditional.jpeg) MR Conditional: no known hazards in a specified MR environment with specified condition of use;

![MR Unsafe](/assets/mrsafety/mrunsafe.jpeg) MR Unsafe: hazardous in all MR environments. 

An unknown object can be evaluated with a handheld metal detector and a strong handheld magnet (>1000G). 
The safety policies should cover the labeling of devices, but also the training for researchers and staff, emergency procedures… To ensure everyone complies with these, it is crucial to clearly explain what the risks are and why the safety policies are established as they are. Among other institutions, the ACR published a very useful guidelines document to help establish these policies [5]; a complete description of the MR Safety roles is available in [6]. The Columbia University Zuckerman Institute policies are available here as an example [link]. 


#### MRI Safety Lab
A dedicated MRI safety lab is recommended, for example to evaluate the impact of the MR environment on a medical implant. Again, several setups and test benches can be established from official standards and publications to study the effect of the static field [7,8], radiofrequency field [9] and gradient fields [10,11].
A list of suggestions for RF studies and RF heating tests is available here [link].
